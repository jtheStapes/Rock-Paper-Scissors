My first JavaScript program built from scratch that plays the popular game "Rock Paper Scissors" against the computer by randomly generating the computer's move. The game is played from the console and the first one to five points wins. Enjoy!

Update: My Rock Paper Scissors game now has a UI that has buttons to click for user selections rather than typing in the selection. I also styled up the webpage to make it look better.

Update 08/12/2022: My Rock Paper Scissors game was completely remade into a new game called "Water Earth Fire Air" based on the popular animated TV show "Avatar: The Last Airbender"
This revamp was so much fun and I learned so much and definitely improved as a programmer when I was finished with this project. Please enjoy!
